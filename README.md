Dotfile (working title)
=======================

Yet another dotfile manager script. This time, written in python. How novel.

**Why not use (insert other manager script here)?**

I didn't write that one. Also, it probably doesn't do what I want it to do. Well, it probably does, but it was kinda fun writing this anyway. Whatever.

Features
--------

Note: a bunch of these are planned features. It's not finished yet, yo.

- [x] Modular system (to allow for submodules/subrepos/general nice management)
- [x] Module dependencies
- [x] Inclusion/exclusion rules based on current environment
- [ ] Optimised symlinking
- [ ] Single-command clean uninstall
- [ ] Other stuff I haven't thought of yet

More fancy documentation and so on to come as I think it up. Also, as I write it. Development and all that.
